# Encryption-and-Decryption-Using-One-Time-Pad-Algorithm
encrypt/decrypt an image using simple mathematical logic. It requires two things, data, and key, and when XOR operation is applied on both the operands i.e data and key, the data gets encrypted but when the same process is done again with the same key-value data gets decrypted.
